# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

# Description
Work day scheduler that allows you to type note in a text field and save. When the page is refreshed the text stays in the text box like normal. Using Day.Js to get the current date and time the box will change colors depending on if the time block is past, present or in the future. Right now that function works if you drag up in the corner of the text area. 

# Screenshot of webpage
You can find screenshot of the webpage in the repo. This shows the issue where the color is displayed only if the box is drug up.
